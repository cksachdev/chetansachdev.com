After upgrading my old MacBook Pro 2010 to High Sierra, the os kept crashing abruptly making it unusable. I kept reporting the crash issues, hoping there will be an upgrade in os which will fix the issue. 
Searching on the web, found a hotfix in NVIDIA graphics, which seems to be fix the issue. Download the app from:

and then Refer to video below for the steps:
